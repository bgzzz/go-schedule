# specific solution's part configuration 

## rpc connection timeouts configuration
# listening_address determines on which address and port
# management node will be listening incoming connections 
listening_address: 127.0.0.1:1234

# ping_timer is period in seconds for sending ping to 
# worker node
ping_timer: 5

# max timeout that server waits for any message to be received or send 
# if timeout expired connection is dropped 
# silence_timeout has to be > ping_timeout
# timeout is in seconds 
silence_timeout: 10


## etcd connection configuration

# the address of the etcd node that is used to store 
# information about worker nodes and scheduled tasks  
etcd_address: 172.17.0.2:2379

# timeout in seconds that is used for etcd connection
etcd_dial_timeout: 10


## scheduler configuration

# algorithm that is used for scheduling tasks
# can be:
        # rr - round-robin
            # scheduler schedules task one by on all available worker nodes
        # rand - rand
            # scheduler randomly picks the node where to schedule the task
scheduler_algo: rr

# timer that is used to change the state of the task
# when the timer is expired task state changed to dead
# timer in seconds
dead_timeout: 60
